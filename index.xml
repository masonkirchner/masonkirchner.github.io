      <description>It was probably long overdue for me to set up a blog. Content on this blog will be some combination of Golang code, machine learning infrastructure, and doing fun stuff with football data.
To make this site I wanted to use something easy, and cheap so I settled on using Hugo, GitHub Pages, Notion as my content delivery tool, and CircleCI for continuous delivery. The only expense here is Notion coming in at $4 a month, but I already used Notion for daily note taking so I consider tying Notion to this site as me getting more bang for my buck.</description>

      <description>Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Mason Kirchner and this is my blog.
I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer that enjoys developing software to facilitate the deployment, serving, and monitoring of machine learning models.
In my spare time I like to practice data science on NFL or college football data, with a particular interest in trying to predict the success of incoming rookies.
