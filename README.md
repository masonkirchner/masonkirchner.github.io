This is the repository that hosts my blog at [masonkirchner.github.io](https://masonkirchner.github.io)

## About

This repository is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the [hugo-theme-basic](https://github.com/siegerts/hugo-theme-basic). The markdown files are created using a script that pulls them from [Notion](https://www.notion.so) pages that I write. [More details can be found here.](https://masonkirchner.github.io/post/making-this-blog)
