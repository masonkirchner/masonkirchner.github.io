      <description>It was probably long overdue for me to set up a blog!
I wanted to use something easy, and cheap, so I settled on using hugo, github pages, and, with a little twist, notion as my content delivery tool.
The notion part is definitely the most interesting in my opinion. It was heavily inspired by https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/a8cf04d756ec4963905960822b004440/powering-a-blog-with-notion-and-netlify.html
I already used Notion daily, and I really liked the idea of simply being able to type into Notion and know that my ramblings would reliably be published to a blog.</description>
