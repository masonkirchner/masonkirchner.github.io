<p>It was probably long overdue for me to set up a blog. Content on this blog will be some combination of Golang code, machine learning infrastructure, and doing fun stuff with football data.</p>

<p>To make this site I wanted to use something easy, and cheap so I settled on using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> as my content delivery tool, and <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a> for continuous delivery. The only expense here is Notion coming in at $4 a month, but I already used Notion for daily note taking so I consider tying Notion to this site as me getting more bang for my buck.</p>

<p>The Notion part is definitely the most interesting part of this build in my opinion. <a href="https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/a8cf04d756ec4963905960822b004440/powering-a-blog-with-notion-and-netlify.html">It was inspired by this post</a>, and I really liked the idea of simply being able to type into Notion and know that I could have the content published.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-built-this">How I Built This</h2>

<p>The workflow that I sought to create is one where I am able to write a page in Notion, and then have a job that I can trigger to pull that page and update my blog with the new page. In this section I&rsquo;ll go into details for how I put this together for those that are interested in making something similar.</p>

<p>To manage the code base and deploy the website, I made two GitHub repositories:</p>

<ul>
<li>One named <code>blog</code> for the Hugo Template and CircleCI script</li>
<li>One named <code>masonkirchner.github.io</code> for the Hugo generated HTML that GitHub Pages will host</li>
</ul>

<p>Next I had to install Hugo, which can be done by following <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">Hugo&rsquo;s installation guide</a>. After installing Hugo, I picked out <a href="https://github.com/siegerts/hugo-theme-basic">hugo-theme-basic</a> from the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo Themes website</a>.</p>

<p>From here, I had to figure out how to interact with the Notion API. After inspecting the network calls while using Notion in my browser, I figured out that there were three requests I needed to use to keep this blog up to date:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>POST /v3/loadPageChunk</code>

<ul>
<li>This returns a list of IDs for the blog post Pages I created.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>POST /v3/enqueueTask</code>

<ul>
<li>This will queue up a Task that will export a Page with a given ID as a markdown file. It returns a Task ID.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>POST /v3/getTasks</code>

<ul>
<li>Given a Task ID, this returns a markdown file representing the Page.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>From here I was able to write a Python script to make these requests to fetch the markdown files that represent the blog posts. From there, I use a bash script to place those markdown files in the <code>content</code> directory of the repository, and then have Hugo generate the static site with those files. Finally, the updated code is used to make a Pull Request to the <code>masonkirchner.github.io</code> repository where I can review any changes to the website before I deploy it to production.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll provide more specific code for this whole process in the next blog post for those that may have had a difficult time following along.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to have this blog up and running! Until next time.</p>

<p>-Mason</p>
